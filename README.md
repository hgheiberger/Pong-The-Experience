# Overview:
A sample dynamic webpage created using Bootstrap 5.0 and Three.js r135 for use as an example final project for the January 2022 session of the MIT-MEET (Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow) program.  The page is a simple 3D pong game that allows users to play against the computer in order to be the first to gain 7 points.  The project also includes an interactive Three.JS landing screen and a few extra aethstic features.
